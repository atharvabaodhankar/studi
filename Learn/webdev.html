            <p>
                Front-End is the UI (User Interface), it deals with the website's overall appearance, on how interactive and dynamic it is. For mastering it, get clear with all the elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h3>HTML : THE SKELETON</h3>
            <p>
                (HyperText Markup Language) - Start with the basic application of HTML by creating a small website that includes all the elements. Play with tables, and forms, and try adding images and links to the website to make it more eye-catching which in return makes your work efficient. Click here to read about the conventions and best practices of HTML.

            <p>
                (Cascading Style Sheets) - If you're a person who loves creativity, you must go through CSS. Using CSS, you can add colors to your website, give borders to the headings or paragraphs, build the navigation bar, play with the icons, font, and text, and many more things like that. Make the website responsive i.e., how it looks on different screen sizes. The most popular CSS framework used is Bootstrap.

            <p>
                A CSS framework is a prepped and ready-to-use CSS library (Cascading Style Sheets). The stylesheets collection makes the job of a UI developer easier. 

                Rather than starting every project from scratch, a CSS framework gives them tools to quickly create a user interface that they repeat and tweak during a project. They also enable the creation of more standards-compliant websites. 
                
                While quite challenging to use or ambiguous for beginners, senior developers who know the CSS framework site's descriptions and buzzwords find them extremely useful.

            <h3>What is Programming?</h3>
            <p>
                The journey of actual programming starts here!
                We will now go deep into programming and concepts of programming.
                Don't worry all languages have the same basic concepts like Variables, Loops, Conditional Statements and many more are common in all programming languages so starting JavaScript will be beneficial for all other languages.
                There are several languages that are frequently used for web development. Some of the most popular programming languages for web development include HTML/CSS, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, and Swift. But this list is not an exhaustive one, and there are several others to turn to when needed.

            <p>
                This is the programming language of the web. Learn about DOM (Document Object Model).

                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

            <p>
                A JavaScript framework is a collection of JavaScript code libraries that provide a web developer with pre-written code for routine programming tasks. Frameworks are structures with a particular context and help you create web applications within that context. <br>
                It is a platform for building software applications. It includes programs, code libraries, and compilers which when brought together enable the development of a project or system. These frameworks make components reusable. Examples of frameworks are - React, Angular, Vue, etc.

            <p>
                congratulations! You ar now a front-end web developer who can build basic but cool websites and now your half way is done its time for backend - THE GOD.

                The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
                
                Now you can easily clone any website with your front-end skills.

            <h3>BACKEND : The GOAT</h3>
            <p>
                Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.

                Back-end developers should know at least one of the programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. JavaScript would be the best choice as this can be used in both the front-end and back-end.

                The database is a collection of data from which we can manage data (store and retrieve). There are two types of databases: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). Some popular databases are: 

              <br>  MySQL - These are relational database management system, store and manages data.
              <br>  MongoDB - It is a NoSQL database; Finds key-value DB, graph DBs
             <br>   VoltDB - It follows a relational pattern, they use memory to store data.
